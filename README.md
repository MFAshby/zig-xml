# zig-xml

zig-xml is an XML library for Zig. It is intended to be as correct and efficient
as possible, providing APIs at varying levels of abstraction to best suit the
needs of different users.

**Warning:** this library is still in early development. Bugs and breaking
changes are highly likely.

## Reading XML

**TODO:** see the doc comments in the code; I keep redesigning the API too often
and don't want to keep the README updated yet.

## Writing XML

**TODO:** https://github.com/ianprime0509/zig-xml/issues/10

## Examples

See the `examples` directory (these examples are not very good right now but
they do show how to use most of the library).

## License

zig-xml is free and open source software, released under the
[MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/MIT/) as found in the `LICENSE`
file of this repository.
